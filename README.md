Key High-Impact Insights from Analysis
ER & ICU have high bed occupancy rates (91.67% and 100%, respectively), while General Ward has only 47.37% occupancy, indicating inefficient bed distribution.
Peak admission hours are 3 AM and 7 AM, with the highest patient volume on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, requiring additional staff coverage during these periods
ER has the shortest consultation wait time (34 minutes), but Pediatrics, Cardiology, and ICU patients wait over 100 minutes, leading to patient dissatisfaction.
Cardiology nurses handle the highest patient load (1,837 patients per nurse), followed by ICU (1,710) and Pediatrics (1,440), increasing staff burnout risks.
Night shift staffs work an average of 9 hours per shift
Some medical equipment such as the Infant Warmer, Oxygen Concentrator, and Ventilator has exceeded recommended usage hours, increasing breakdown risks and potential equipment failure during critical care.
NHIS and Private HMO patients have the lowest profit margins (17.6–17.9%), making them less financially sustainable compared to self-pay patients. Although NHIS patients generate a higher average bill per patient (₦161K) than self-pay patients (₦146K), higher associated expenses and lower reimbursement rates limit overall hospital profitability.


Final Summary of Key Actions
✅ Reallocate 20 beds from General Ward to ER & ICU to reduce overcrowding. Expand ICU by converting underused wards into step-down units for stable patients.
✅ Hire additional ER & ICU doctors and nurses to reduce patient wait times and prevent staff burnout.
✅ Implement digital queue management to streamline check-ins and reduce consultation wait times.
✅ Perform preventive maintenance on overused Infant Warmers, Oxygen Concentrators, and Ventilators to prevent equipment failure.
✅ Rotate underutilized equipment, such as X-ray machines, to high-demand departments for better utilization.
✅ Adjust staffing schedules to ensure more staff are available during peak admission hours (3 AM and 7 AM) and high-volume days (Tuesdays & Wednesdays).
✅ Increase self-pay services by marketing premium healthcare options, including VIP consultation services, to attract more self-pay patients and improve revenue.
✅ Negotiate higher NHIS reimbursement rates to increase hospital profitability and reduce reliance on low-margin insurance patients.
